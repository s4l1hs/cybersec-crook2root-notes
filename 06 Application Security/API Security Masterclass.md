# 🔌 2.4 API Security Masterclass

> [!abstract] The Masterclass
> Modern apps *are* APIs — a back-end exposing JSON endpoints consumed by web, mobile, and third-party clients simultaneously. That makes the API the critical attack surface: there's no UI to constrain what you send, so an assessor crafts raw requests directly, unlocking vulnerability classes rare in traditional web testing. This chapter covers API fundamentals, a repeatable testing methodology, and the full **OWASP API Security Top 10** in depth. It's the API-specific counterpart to the **web OWASP Top 10**. **`#level/operator`**

> [!warning] Authorized Red-Team / Vulnerability-Assessment context
> All testing below assumes **in-scope, authorized endpoints** (typically delivered as a Postman/Insomnia collection or OpenAPI spec). The framing is **defensive architecture testing**: find the flaw, prove it safely, and remediate.

> [!tip] Chapter Map

## API Fundamentals

The dominant style is **REST** (Representational State Transfer) — an architectural convention over HTTP, not a strict protocol. A **RESTful API** exposes **resources** (a user, product, order) at **endpoints** in a predictable, hierarchical, versioned structure: `/v1/users`, `/v1/users/42`, `/v1/users/42/orders`.

![[645b19f5d5848d004ab9c9e2-1774422667931.svg]]

**HTTP methods map to CRUD** — and the mapping itself is a test surface (does `DELETE` actually check authorization?):

| Method | CRUD | Note for testing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | Read (never mutate) | A `GET` that changes state is a design smell |
| `POST` | Create | Main body-injection surface |
| `PUT` | Full replace | Omitted fields may null-out — data loss / logic bugs |
| `PATCH` | Partial update | Extra fields → **** |
| `DELETE` | Delete | Often the least-authorized-checked verb |

**Status codes that matter:** `200/201/204` success; `400` bad input (probe validation); **`401`** = *who are you?* (missing/invalid auth); **`403`** = *I know you, but no* (the key BOLA/authorization signal); `404` not found; `405` method not allowed; `429` rate-limited; `500` server error (may reveal injection or a logic flaw). The `401` vs `403` distinction is the single most useful tell in authorization testing — a `403` that flips to `200` when you change an ID is a finding.

---

## Authentication Mechanisms

| Mechanism | How it works | Weakness to test |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **API Keys** (`X-API-Key: …`) | A static key identifies the client | Long-lived, shared across environments, committed to git — full access if leaked, until rotated |
| **Bearer Tokens** (`Authorization: Bearer …`) | Login returns a short-lived, revocable token | Theft in transit/storage; check expiry & revocation |
| **JWT** | Self-contained `header.payload.signature` | Payload is **encoded, not encrypted** — decode it; then test every flaw in **Web Fundamentals (JWT Security)** |

Decode any JWT you capture and read `user_id`, `role`, `exp` — those claims drive every authorization decision the API makes, and are exactly what BOLA/BFLA testing manipulates.

---

## API Pentesting Methodology

1. **Map** the surface — import the Postman/Insomnia collection, parse OpenAPI/Swagger docs, and proxy the mobile/web client through **Burp Suite** to catch **undocumented** endpoints.
2. **Authenticate** with two low-privilege accounts (A and B) plus, if available, an admin — you need multiple identities to prove authorization flaws.
3. **Test authorization on every endpoint** — swap A's token onto B's objects/functions. The flaws below are mostly authorization failures the framework does *not* fix for you.
4. **Inspect responses** for over-exposed fields; **probe** request bodies for extra writable fields; **burst** requests to check rate limits.

> The single most important truth: most API frameworks handle authentication and routing, but **object-level and function-level authorization must be coded into every endpoint by hand** — miss one and you have a critical bug.

---

## Broken Object Level Authorisation (BOLA)

**API1 — the #1 API risk**, because it's ubiquitous and yields mass data exposure. The API authenticates the user but doesn't verify they're allowed to access the *specific object* requested. (This is **IDOR** in API form.)

![[645b19f5d5848d004ab9c9e2-1774422709746.svg]]

Authenticated as user 4, you request your data — then change the ID:
```
GET /v1/users/4/orders   → 200 OK (yours)
GET /v1/users/1/orders   → 200 OK (user 1's!)   ← vulnerable: no ownership check
```
A secure API compares the **token's** user ID against the **URL's** and returns `403 Forbidden`:

![[Pasted image 20260302160929.png]]

BOLA appears in path params, query strings (`?owner_id=13`), body fields (`{"user_id":13}`), and headers (`X-User-ID: 13`). **Scaling is trivial** — sequential integer IDs let a `1..10000` loop exfiltrate every user in seconds. UUIDs add obscurity, not security (they leak via other endpoints and logs).

> **Fix:** enforce ownership on **every** endpoint (not a single global middleware — the user↔resource relationship differs per route), keyed to the authenticated identity from the token. Use unpredictable references and deny by default.

---

## Broken User Authentication (BUA)

**API2.** Flaws in verifying identity. The most common is **no rate limiting on login/auth endpoints**, enabling brute-force and **credential stuffing** (replaying breach-sourced credential pairs against a password-reusing user base). APIs skip CAPTCHA/lockout more often than web apps because they're built for programmatic access.

![[Pasted image 20260302161313.png]]

Plus the JWT failures — **weak HS256 secrets** (`hashcat -m 16500` / `jwt_tool` → forge tokens), **`alg:none`**, and **missing `exp` validation** (a stolen token valid forever). Full set: **Web Fundamentals (JWT Security)**.

> **Fix:** rate-limit + lockout on all auth endpoints, **MFA**, strong signing secrets, reject `none`, validate `exp`/`aud`, and keep token lifetimes short.

---

## Excessive Data Exposure

**API3.** The back-end returns **entire database objects** and trusts the front-end to hide sensitive fields. But the raw JSON already left the server — anyone using **Burp Suite** or browser dev-tools sees everything.

![[645b19f5d5848d004ab9c9e2-1774422771128.svg]]

The UI renders `username`/`email`/avatar; the raw response also carries `password_hash`, `api_key`, `internal_notes`, `last_login_ip`, `is_admin`. Front-end filtering provides **zero** security.

![[Pasted image 20260302170751.png]]

Combined with **BOLA** this escalates from a moderate access-control issue to a **full data breach** — and it also *reveals the field names* an attacker then injects in ****.

> **Fix:** server-side **response filtering / serialization schemas** per role — never `return user` (the whole ORM object); return an explicit DTO with only the fields that role should see.

---

## Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting

**API4.** Missing rate limits affect *every* endpoint, not just login: brute-force **4-digit OTPs** (only 10,000 combinations), scrape data at scale, abuse costly actions (SMS/email sends, report generation), or cause **DoS** with heavy queries.

![[Pasted image 20260302170913.png]]

Test it: send a burst of identical requests and watch for `429 Too Many Requests`. Well-built APIs return `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, and `X-RateLimit-Reset` headers; their absence usually means no limiting is in place.

> **Fix:** global rate limiting with **stricter caps on sensitive endpoints** (login, OTP, password reset), request-size/complexity limits, pagination caps, timeouts, and the standard rate-limit response headers.

---

## Broken Function Level Authorisation

**API5.** Like BOLA but for **actions/functions** rather than objects — a regular user reaching **administrative functionality** because the endpoint checks authentication but not **role**.
```
GET    /v1/users/me         → normal endpoint (fine)
GET    /v1/admin/users      → 200 OK for a non-admin?     ← broken function-level auth
DELETE /v1/users/99          → can a normal user delete another user?
POST   /v1/users/1/promote   → self-promote to admin?
```
![[Pasted image 20260302171050.png]]

Discovery: take an admin-only request captured from an admin session and replay it with a **low-privilege** token; a `200` instead of `403` is the finding. Also fuzz predictable admin paths (`/admin`, `/internal`, `/v1/manage`).

> **Fix:** deny-by-default authorization; verify **role/permission** on every administrative and state-changing route (centralised, not per-controller); never rely on the client hiding admin buttons or the endpoint being "unlinked."

---

## Mass Assignment

**API6.** The API binds client request data **directly** to internal object fields without an allow-list. The server object has `role`, `is_admin`, `credit_balance`, `email_verified` — normally server-controlled — and the API accepts them if the client injects them:
```http
PATCH /v1/users/me
{"email":"new@shop.thm", "role":"admin"}      ← privilege escalation, no auth flaw needed
```
![[645b19f5d5848d004ab9c9e2-1774422819850.svg]]
![[Pasted image 20260302180421.png]]

You learn injectable field names from the API's own **over-exposed responses** or from OpenAPI `readOnly` hints (which reveal a field exists — the question is whether the server actually enforces the constraint). Prevalent in auto-binding ORMs (Laravel, CodeIgniter, Rails).

> **Fix:** explicit **input allow-list** of client-writable fields per endpoint (DTOs / `fillable` / strong params); silently drop anything else; `role`/`is_admin`/`permissions`/`balance` must never be client-writable.

---

## Security Misconfiguration

**API7.** Default configs, verbose errors/stack traces (leaking framework, version, file paths), missing security headers, **permissive CORS** (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` *with* credentials lets any site read authenticated responses), unnecessary HTTP methods enabled, and unpatched servers.

![[Pasted image 20260302180540.png]]

Test CORS by sending `Origin: https://evil.com` and checking whether it's reflected back in `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` alongside `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`.

> **Fix:** hardened repeatable baseline, generic error responses, **strict CORS** (explicit origin allow-list, never `*` with credentials), disable unused methods, ship security headers, and patch on a cadence. Mirrors **web A05**.

---

## Injection

**API8.** Untrusted input reaches an interpreter — **SQL, NoSQL, command, LDAP**. APIs are prime targets because they take structured JSON straight into queries, and **NoSQL** injection via typed JSON is API-specific:
```javascript
// ❌ NoSQL (MongoDB) auth bypass via a typed JSON body
{"username": {"$ne": null}, "password": {"$ne": null}}   // "not equal to null" matches any user
{"username": "admin", "password": {"$gt": ""}}            // "greater than empty" → logs in as admin
```
![[Pasted image 20260302180651.png]]

> **Fix:** parameterised queries, strict input **typing and validation** (reject objects where a string is expected — the root of NoSQL operator injection), ORM-safe methods, and least-privilege DB accounts. Full family: **SQLi**, **command injection**.

---

## Improper Assets Management

**API9.** APIs sprawl across versions and environments: old versions (`/v1` left running beside the patched `/v3`), undocumented **shadow** endpoints, beta/debug routes, and staging hosts exposed to the internet. Deprecated versions frequently lack the newer security fixes, so attackers *downgrade* to the weak one.

![[Pasted image 20260302180801.png]]

Discovery: enumerate versions (`/v1`, `/v2`, `/v3`, `/beta`, `/internal`), diff their behaviour, and check `Improper` hosts (`api-dev.`, `staging-api.`) found via **subdomain enumeration**.

> **Fix:** maintain an authoritative **inventory** of every API, version, and host; formally retire (not just "hide") old versions; keep non-production environments off the public internet; and keep documentation current so shadow endpoints don't accumulate.

---

## Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

**API10.** API attacks are automated and high-volume — without logging of authentication failures, authorization denials (`401`/`403`), and anomalies, they run unseen. This is the API face of **web A09**.

![[Pasted image 20260302180904.png]]

> **Fix:** log security events with context (identity, endpoint, source, outcome — but never the secrets themselves), forward to a tamper-resistant SIEM, and alert on `401`/`403` spikes, sequential-ID enumeration, and rate-limit breaches. Ties to **host logging**.
