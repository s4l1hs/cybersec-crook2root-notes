# RFID & Physical Access Testing

> [!abstract] Enterprise methodology
> Physical-access testing evaluates badge technology, enrollment, reader/controller trust, anti-passback, visitor handling, tailgating resistance, alarm response, and how facility access connects to logical identity. Cloning tests use synthetic badges only.

> [!danger] Safety and legality
> Never copy employee credentials, enter unapproved areas, interfere with life-safety systems, or test emergency exits without facility authorization. Assign an escort, stop word, approved doors, synthetic badges, and emergency contacts.

## Access-control architecture

    B["Badge / mobile credential"] --> R["Reader"]
    R --> C["Door controller"]

    S --> I["Identity / HR lifecycle"]
    C --> L["Lock and door sensor"]
    S --> M["Monitoring and guard response"]

## Technology model

| Technology | Typical security concern |
|---|---|
| Low-frequency proximity | Static identifier, easy replay/cloning in weak deployments |
| High-frequency smart card | Security depends on mutual authentication and key management |
| NFC/mobile credential | Device trust, app lifecycle, relay resistance, backend authorization |
| Barcode/magnetic stripe | Copyability and weak visual/reader validation |
| Biometric factor | Template protection, liveness, fallback and privacy |

The visible card format does not prove the protocol or cryptography. Inventory reader model, credential family, frequency, controller, backend, and key-management ownership.

## Synthetic badge assessment

Create badges expressly for testing:

```text
Badge A: standard employee, building only
Badge B: contractor, weekdays 08:00–18:00
Badge C: revoked test identity
Badge D: privileged lab-zone access
```

Test enrollment, duplication detection, revocation latency, lost-card workflow, expiration, PIN/biometric combinations, and whether a copied identifier is sufficient without cryptographic authentication.

Representative reader evidence:

```text
2026-07-30T20:14:02Z Door=LAB-2 Badge=AUDIT-C Result=DENIED Reason=REVOKED
2026-07-30T20:14:17Z Door=LOBBY Badge=AUDIT-A Result=GRANTED
2026-07-30T20:15:03Z Door=LAB-2 Badge=AUDIT-A Result=DENIED Reason=NO_ACCESS
```

## Cloning and replay methodology

Only clone a synthetic test credential. The objective is to determine whether the system authenticates a static identifier or performs cryptographic challenge-response. If a duplicate is accepted, test whether backend analytics detect impossible travel, simultaneous use, or duplicate identifiers.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant B as Test badge
    participant R as Reader
    participant C as Controller
    B->>R: Identifier or cryptographic response
    R->>C: Credential + reader + event
    C-->>R: Grant / deny
    Note over B,C: Static identifiers can be replayed; mutual authentication resists copying
```

## Physical-process testing

- Tailgating and piggybacking using approved scenarios.
- Reception identity verification and visitor badges.
- Door-held-open and forced-door alarms.
- Anti-passback and occupancy logic.
- Contractor/offboarding revocation.
- Server-room, network-closet, loading-dock, and roof access.
- Badge plus workstation identity correlation.
- Guard escalation and evidence preservation.

Never exploit politeness with uninformed vulnerable individuals. Use trained participants or approved broad exercises with safety controls.

## Findings and remediation

```text
Condition: revoked synthetic badge remained active for 47 minutes
Expected: revocation propagated within five minutes
Impact: offboarded identity could retain facility access
Root cause: branch controller sync interval and offline cache
Remediation: reduce sync interval; alert on stale controller; verify revocation SLA
```

Prefer cryptographic credentials, diversified keys, secure enrollment, rapid revocation, anti-passback, controller hardening, monitored door sensors, and lifecycle integration with HR/identity systems.

## Credential-system model

Map credential technology, frequency, identifier/authentication mechanism, reader, controller, panel, door hardware, request-to-exit, alarm contacts, anti-passback, access rules, management server, logging, and identity lifecycle. A badge number is not the entire security system.

Legacy low-frequency identifiers may transmit static IDs; higher-frequency smartcards can provide mutual authentication and diversified keys when correctly deployed. Technology name alone does not prove secure configuration.

## Safe assessment workflow

Inventory approved test credentials/readers, record facility and life-safety exclusions, observe normal transactions, identify technology without transmitting where possible, test only canary credentials, demonstrate at a noncritical test reader, and reconcile controller logs. Never interfere with emergency egress, fire systems, elevators, medical areas, or occupied secure spaces.

```text
Canary credential: FACILITY-TEST-0042
Reader: LAB-DOOR-03
Authorized window: 10:00–11:00 UTC
Expected result: access granted once, anti-passback on replay
Observed: two grants; replay protection absent at controller workflow
```

## Defense-in-depth

Use cryptographic credentials, diversified keys, secure enrollment, rapid revocation, anti-passback where appropriate, PIN/biometric for high-risk zones, reader tamper monitoring, encrypted panel communication, segmented management, camera/alarm correlation, and physical-key governance. Reader replacement alone does not fix weak controller rules or identity lifecycle.

## Mastery lab

Model a three-zone facility with canary cards. Test issue/revoke, schedule, role, anti-passback, lost-card response, reader tamper alert, and log correlation. Produce an attack-path diagram from credential acquisition to business asset while respecting life safety and stopping at the first bounded proof.

## Core Concept

**RFID & Physical Access Testing** is the atomic learning objective of this note. Identify its trust boundary, prerequisites, attacker-controlled input or state, vulnerable transformation, violated security invariant, minimum evidence, business consequence, and safe stopping point. The mechanism must remain explainable without depending on a specific product.

## Visual Attack Flow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["Scoped prerequisite"] --> B["RFID & Physical Access Testing mechanics"]
    B --> C["Trust boundary crossed"]
    C --> D["Bounded canary proof"]
    D --> E["Detection, remediation & retest"]
```

## Practical Payloads & Execution

```text
exercise=RFID & Physical Access Testing
cohort=privacy-approved canary group
maximum_action=harmless marker
real_credentials_collected=false
```

### Expected output

```text
prevented_or_reported=true
participant_harm=none
control_owner=identified
```

Treat the output as proof of only the stated condition. Repeat with a negative control, preserve timestamps and the affected build, and never expand impact merely because another path appears reachable.

## Real-World Scenario

A privacy-approved enterprise exercise applies **RFID & Physical Access Testing** with synthetic identities and a harmless canary action. Legal, HR, privacy, and the white team define prohibited themes and stop conditions; results measure process and control performance rather than individuals.

The durable remediation belongs at the authoritative enforcement layer. Retest the original condition and meaningful variants while verifying legitimate workflows still function.
