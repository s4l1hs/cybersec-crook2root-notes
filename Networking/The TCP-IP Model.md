# 🧩 The TCP-IP Model

> [!abstract] Note of [[Network Foundations]]
> OSI is the vocabulary; TCP/IP is the implementation every device actually runs. This note explains the four-layer suite as specified in RFC 1122, why it collapsed OSI's top three layers, where the two models genuinely disagree, and how the hourglass shape of the suite explains both the Internet's success and its security weaknesses.

## Parent Learning Order
Network Types & Topologies -> The OSI Model -> The TCP-IP Model -> Encapsulation & Protocol Data Units -> Network Devices & Traffic Paths -> Reachability Testing & ICMP

## Start at Zero: The Model That Shipped

OSI was designed by committee as a complete reference architecture. TCP/IP was built by implementers who needed working code, and it won because the code worked. The suite is formally described in RFC 1122 and RFC 1123 as four layers.

| TCP/IP layer | OSI equivalent | Job | Protocols |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Application** | 7 + 6 + 5 | Everything the program cares about | HTTP, DNS, SSH, SMTP, TLS |
| **Transport** | 4 | Deliver to the right program, with or without reliability | TCP, UDP |
| **Internet** | 3 | Address and route between networks | IP, ICMP, IPsec |
| **Link** | 2 + 1 | Move a frame across one physical link | Ethernet, 802.11, ARP, PPP |

The collapse at the top is not an oversimplification — it reflects reality. In practice a program manages its own dialogue state and its own encoding, so separating "session" and "presentation" from "application" creates boundaries nobody implements. The collapse at the bottom reflects the same pragmatism: to the IP layer, a link is simply something that can carry a datagram to a next hop, and whether that link is copper, fibre, or radio is the link technology's business.

> [!tip] Which model should you use?
> Use OSI when you need to *talk about a failure* — "this is a Layer 2 problem" is universally understood. Use TCP/IP when you need to *reason about a real packet* — because that is what the header stack actually contains. They are not competitors; they are a vocabulary and an implementation.

## The Hourglass: Why IP Is the Waist

The single most important structural property of the suite is that it is narrow in the middle and wide at both ends. Many link technologies exist below; many applications exist above; and between them there is essentially one network protocol.

    subgraph Applications

        DNS["DNS"]
        SSH["SSH"]
        SMTP["SMTP"]
    end
    subgraph Transport
        TCP["TCP"]
        UDP["UDP"]
    end
    IP["IP — the narrow waist"]
    subgraph Links
        ETH["Ethernet"]
        WIFI["802.11"]
        PPP["PPP"]
        LTE["Cellular"]
    end
    HTTP --> TCP
    DNS --> UDP
    DNS --> TCP
    SSH --> TCP
    SMTP --> TCP
    TCP --> IP
    UDP --> IP
    IP --> ETH
    IP --> WIFI
    IP --> PPP
    IP --> LTE
```

The waist is why the Internet scaled. A new application does not need permission from link technologies, and a new link technology does not need to know about applications; both only have to speak IP. Anything that must be changed *at the waist* — the move to IPv6 is the canonical example — is extraordinarily slow precisely because everything depends on it.

The waist is also the root of a security property. Because IP carries no notion of identity or integrity, and because it must remain simple enough for every device to implement, security was pushed outward: to the link layer (802.1X, WPA), to transport and above (TLS, SSH), or bolted onto the waist as an option (IPsec). There is no layer at which "the network authenticates the sender" by default, and that single fact explains source spoofing, on-path attacks, and the entire industry built to compensate.

## Following One Request Through the Suite

Consider a browser fetching `https://shop.example.com/cart`. Watch the layers do their work in order.

**Application** decides the intent: an HTTP `GET` for `/cart`, with a `Host` header and cookies. But before any of that, a *different* application-layer protocol runs — DNS must turn the name into an address.

**Transport** opens a TCP connection to port 443, choosing an ephemeral source port so the reply can be matched back to this browser tab. TLS then negotiates keys over that connection; because TLS sits above TCP but below HTTP, it is the clearest example of the model's imperfect boundaries.

**Internet** wraps each segment in an IP header carrying the source and destination addresses, consults the routing table for a next hop, and decrements TTL at every router along the way.

**Link** wraps the packet in a frame addressed to the next hop's hardware address — the gateway's, not the server's — and hands it to the physical medium.

The critical subtlety is that the addresses at different layers change at different rates. The IP addresses stay constant end-to-end. The link-layer addresses are rewritten at *every hop*, because each hop is a new link. Beginners who conflate the two cannot explain why a captured frame shows the gateway's hardware address rather than the server's.

```bash
ss -tnp state established '( dport = :443 )'
```

Expected excerpt:

```text
Recv-Q Send-Q      Local Address:Port      Peer Address:Port  Process
     0      0     192.168.10.24:52418        93.184.216.34:443  users:(("firefox",pid=4412,fd=91))
```

Read this as the transport layer made visible. `192.168.10.24:52418` is the local half of the socket — the ephemeral port is how the kernel demultiplexes this reply to Firefox rather than to some other process. The four values plus the protocol form the five-tuple that uniquely identifies the connection. Nothing here says anything about HTTP; that is one layer up and invisible to `ss`.

## Where the Models Genuinely Disagree

Memorizing a mapping table hides three real disagreements worth understanding.

**ARP has no clean home.** Address Resolution Protocol maps an IP address to a hardware address. It is used *by* the Internet layer but travels *inside* link-layer frames and is not carried in IP. OSI purists call it Layer 2.5; RFC 1122 places it in the Link layer. The honest answer is that it is a layer-crossing helper, and its lack of authentication is a direct consequence of being designed as plumbing rather than a protocol with peers to verify.

**TLS spans a boundary.** It runs over a reliable transport, provides Layer 6 services, and is configured by applications. QUIC goes further: it implements transport reliability, ordering, and TLS-equivalent security *together*, over UDP. In QUIC, asking "which layer is this?" is not a meaningful question — the layers were deliberately merged to remove a round trip and to escape the ossification of middleboxes that inspect TCP.

**Tunnelling breaks the ordering entirely.** A VPN carries IP inside IP, or IP inside UDP. The layer stack becomes recursive rather than linear, and the "layer" of a given header depends on which encapsulation you are currently inside. Any analysis tool must track depth, not just position.

These are not trivia. Each one is a place where a control that assumes strict layering can be bypassed — a firewall that inspects the outer header only, an IDS that cannot parse the inner protocol, a policy that assumes TCP.

## Security Implications

Offensive and defensive tooling is organized around this suite, and knowing which layer a tool operates at tells you what its results can and cannot prove.

A port scanner manipulates transport-layer state — it constructs TCP segments and interprets the responses. Its results describe reachability and listener state, not application health. A packet-crafting tool operates at the Internet and Transport layers and can therefore forge fields that higher-layer tools take on trust. A capture tool decodes all four layers at once, which is why it is the arbiter when tools at different layers disagree.

The pattern to internalize: **every layer trusts the layer beneath it to have done its job honestly, and none of them verify it by default.** An application trusts that the transport delivered data from the peer it believes it is talking to. Transport trusts that IP delivered from the stated source. IP trusts that the link delivered from the stated device. Break any link in that chain low enough, and everything above inherits the lie. This is the mechanism behind on-path attacks, and the reason authentication has to be end-to-end and cryptographic rather than positional.

All traffic generation described here belongs on systems within an authorized scope. Crafted packets and scans are recorded by network telemetry, and probing outside an agreed boundary is out of scope regardless of intent.

## Authorized Lab: Watch the Four Layers in One Exchange

On an isolated lab host you control, capture a single exchange and identify each layer's header.

1. Start a capture limited to a few packets so the output stays readable:

```bash
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -nn -e -c 6 'port 53'
```

2. In a second shell, trigger exactly one name lookup:

```bash
dig +short lab.internal.example @192.168.10.53
```

3. Read the captured header stack from the outside in.

Expected excerpt:

```text
00:1a:2b:3c:4d:5e > 00:50:56:aa:bb:cc, ethertype IPv4 (0x0800), length 84:
192.168.10.24.41823 > 192.168.10.53.53: 39821+ A? lab.internal.example. (42)
00:50:56:aa:bb:cc > 00:1a:2b:3c:4d:5e, ethertype IPv4 (0x0800), length 100:
192.168.10.53.53 > 192.168.10.24.41823: 39821 1/0/0 A 10.10.20.15 (58)
```

Expected interpretation:

```text
Link layer     -> the two hardware addresses and ethertype 0x0800 ("IPv4 follows")
Internet layer -> 192.168.10.24 and 192.168.10.53
Transport layer-> UDP ports 41823 (ephemeral) and 53 (service)
Application    -> query ID 39821, an A record request, and the answer 10.10.20.15
```

4. Confirm the reply reuses query ID 39821 and the same ephemeral port. That pairing is the only thing binding the answer to the question — which is precisely why off-path spoofing of DNS responses is a real attack and why source-port randomization matters.

5. Stop the capture. Nothing persists, so no cleanup is required beyond ending the process.

## Crook → Operator → Root Checkpoint

- **Crook:** Name the four layers, map them to OSI, and explain why the top three OSI layers were collapsed into one.
- **Operator:** Read a capture and attribute each header to its layer; use `ss` to identify the five-tuple of a live connection and explain what the ephemeral port is for.
- **Root:** Explain the hourglass model and its consequences for both innovation and security; describe why ARP, TLS, and QUIC resist clean placement, and how tunnelling turns the layer stack into a recursive structure that layer-assuming controls fail to inspect.
