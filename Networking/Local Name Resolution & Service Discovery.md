# 🏠 Local Name Resolution & Service Discovery

> [!abstract] Note of [[Core Network Services]]
> Before a host asks DNS, it consults a chain of local mechanisms — a static file, then broadcast-based protocols that let devices name themselves with no server at all. Those fallbacks make home networks work without configuration and make enterprise networks leak credentials, because a protocol that trusts any answer on the segment is a protocol an attacker answers first.

## Parent Learning Order
DNS Resolution & Records -> DNS Security & Encrypted Transports -> Local Name Resolution & Service Discovery -> Network Time Synchronization -> Email Transport Protocols -> Network Management Protocols

## Start at Zero: Resolution Before DNS

Name resolution is not a single lookup to DNS. The operating system consults sources in a configured order, and understanding that order is the key to both diagnosis and the security problems here.

On a typical Linux system the order is set by `nsswitch.conf`:

```bash
grep hosts /etc/nsswitch.conf
```

Expected output:

```text
hosts: files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns
```

Read left to right: check local **files** first, then **mDNS** for `.local` names, then **DNS**. Windows has an analogous chain that historically includes the hosts file, DNS, and then broadcast fallbacks (LLMNR and NetBIOS).

The first source is always the **hosts file** — `/etc/hosts` on Unix-like systems, a similar file on Windows. It is a static, manually maintained mapping consulted before any network lookup:

```text
127.0.0.1   localhost
203.0.113.10 www.internal.example
```

Because it wins over DNS, the hosts file is both a useful override (pin a name during testing) and a malware persistence technique (redirect a security-update domain to a dead address, or a bank to a phishing host). Checking the hosts file for unexpected entries is a basic compromise check precisely because it silently overrides everything below it.

## The Zero-Configuration Fallbacks

The interesting mechanisms are the broadcast-based protocols that let devices resolve names and discover services with **no DNS server and no configuration at all**.

**mDNS (Multicast DNS)** resolves `.local` names by multicasting the query to the whole segment; the host that owns the name answers. It is how `printer.local` resolves on a home network with no infrastructure. Paired with **DNS-SD (DNS Service Discovery)**, it also advertises *services* — this is the technology behind automatic discovery of printers, media devices, and file shares.

**LLMNR (Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution)** is a Windows protocol that resolves names by multicast when DNS fails. **NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS)** is an older broadcast-based mechanism serving the same fallback role.

The unifying principle, and the vulnerability, is identical across all three: **when a name cannot be resolved normally, the host shouts the query to the entire local segment and trusts whichever device answers.** There is no authentication. There is no authority. The first plausible answer wins.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant V as Victim
    participant Seg as Local segment (multicast/broadcast)
    participant A as Attacker (listening)
    V->>V: DNS lookup for "fileserver" fails (typo or unqualified name)
    V->>Seg: LLMNR/mDNS/NBT-NS: "who is fileserver?"
    Note over Seg: No authority — anyone may answer
    A-->>V: "I am fileserver, connect to me"
    V->>A: Connects and attempts to authenticate
    Note over A: Captures the authentication material
```

## Why This Leaks Credentials

The attack is not merely misdirection — it harvests authentication. On Windows networks, when a client connects to what it believes is a file server, it automatically attempts to authenticate, sending an NTLM authentication exchange. An attacker who answered the name query receives that exchange and captures the challenge-response material, which can then be cracked offline to recover a password or relayed to another service to authenticate as the user.

This is one of the most reliably productive techniques in internal network assessment, and its power comes from how *ordinary* the trigger is. A user mistyping a share name, an application referring to a host by an unqualified name that DNS cannot resolve, or a stale login script all generate the failed lookup that starts the sequence. The attacker does nothing but wait and answer.

```bash
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -nn 'udp port 5355 or udp port 137 or udp port 5353'
```

Expected excerpt:

```text
IP 192.168.10.30.54211 > 224.0.0.252.5355: UDP, length 24   # LLMNR query
IP 192.168.10.30.137 > 192.168.10.255.137: UDP, length 50   # NetBIOS broadcast
IP 192.168.10.44.5353 > 224.0.0.251.5353: UDP, length 32    # mDNS query
```

Seeing LLMNR (5355) and NetBIOS (137) queries on an enterprise segment is itself a finding: these protocols are usually unnecessary where DNS is properly configured, and every query is an opportunity for an attacker to answer. Their presence indicates both an attack surface and, often, a DNS misconfiguration causing the failed lookups that trigger them.

## WPAD: The Fallback That Redirects All Traffic

A particularly dangerous case combines these protocols with proxy autoconfiguration. **WPAD (Web Proxy Auto-Discovery)** has clients look up the name `wpad` to find a proxy configuration file. If that lookup falls through to LLMNR or NetBIOS, an attacker answers, supplies a proxy configuration pointing at themselves, and thereby routes the victim's **web traffic** through an attacker-controlled proxy. A single answered name query becomes an on-path position for HTTP. Disabling WPAD where it is not needed removes this path.

## Security Implications

**These protocols should be disabled in managed environments.** LLMNR, NBT-NS, and mDNS provide convenience that a correctly configured DNS infrastructure does not need. Disabling them — via group policy on Windows, by ensuring names resolve through DNS so the fallback never triggers — removes the credential-harvesting and traffic-redirection surface entirely. This is a standard hardening recommendation with broad consensus.

**Where they must remain, monitor and segment.** Some environments genuinely need mDNS for device discovery. There, the mitigations are network segmentation so discovery traffic stays within a trusted VLAN, monitoring for the query patterns above, and ensuring the segment does not also carry high-value authentication.

**The failed lookup is the real root cause.** Every attack here begins with a name that DNS could not resolve. Correct DNS configuration — proper search suffixes, complete records, no reliance on unqualified names — means the fallback protocols are never invoked, which defeats the attack without touching the protocols themselves. Fixing the DNS hygiene is often more durable than fighting the fallback.

**The hosts file is a persistence and redirection vector.** Because it overrides all network resolution, an attacker who can write to it redirects any name silently. It is small, rarely reviewed, and high-impact — a natural place for both malware and integrity monitoring to focus.

**Attribution is weak.** These protocols are unauthenticated and broadcast-based, so a captured query attributes a request to a source address that is itself unverified. Treat the evidence as indicative, not conclusive.

All interception described here must be confined to an isolated lab you own. Answering name queries on a network you do not control captures other users' authentication material and is unauthorized.

## Authorized Lab: Answer a Name First

Use an isolated Windows-and-Linux lab: a victim (Windows is ideal for the credential portion), an attacker VM, and no dependence on any production network.

1. **Observe the resolution order.** On the victim, examine the hosts file and the resolution configuration, and confirm the order in which sources are consulted.
2. **Trigger a fallback.** From the victim, attempt to reach a name that DNS cannot resolve — an unqualified or mistyped host name. Capture the resulting LLMNR/mDNS/NBT-NS query on the segment with the tcpdump filter above.
3. **Answer as the attacker.** Run a name-spoofing responder tool on the attacker VM that answers these multicast/broadcast queries. Repeat the victim's failed lookup and confirm the victim now resolves the name to the attacker's address.
4. **Capture the authentication exchange.** Have the victim attempt to connect to the spoofed "server." Confirm the attacker receives the authentication material, and note how little the attacker did — only listen and answer.
5. **Demonstrate the WPAD path.** Configure the victim to auto-discover a proxy, trigger the `wpad` lookup, answer it from the attacker, and confirm the victim's web requests now traverse the attacker's proxy.
6. **Apply the controls.** Disable LLMNR, NBT-NS, and WPAD on the victim (and ensure the name resolves correctly via DNS). Repeat every step and confirm no fallback query is emitted and the attack no longer functions.
7. **Cleanup.** Restore the victim's original configuration if a baseline is required, stop the responder, and confirm normal name resolution.

Expected interpretation:

```text
Failed DNS lookup -> host falls back to multicast/broadcast and trusts any answer
Attacker answers  -> victim resolves a name to the attacker with no authentication
Connection made   -> authentication material captured passively
WPAD answered     -> victim's web traffic routed through the attacker
Protocols disabled-> no fallback query emitted; the attack surface is gone
```

## Crook → Operator → Root Checkpoint

- **Crook:** Describe the resolution order from hosts file through fallback protocols to DNS, and explain what mDNS, LLMNR, and NetBIOS have in common.
- **Operator:** Identify LLMNR/mDNS/NBT-NS queries in a capture, explain why their presence on an enterprise segment is a finding, and recognize the failed DNS lookup as the trigger.
- **Root:** Explain how an unauthenticated name answer leads to NTLM credential capture and how WPAD extends it to web-traffic redirection; argue why disabling the fallbacks and fixing DNS hygiene are the durable controls, and why the hosts file is a distinct persistence vector overriding them all.
