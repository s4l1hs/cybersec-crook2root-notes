# 🌐 BGP & Internet Routing

> [!abstract] Note of [[Routing & the Network Layer]]
> The Internet is not one network but tens of thousands of independent ones that agree, moment to moment, on how to reach each other. The protocol that negotiates that agreement runs on trust between strangers, which is why a single false announcement has repeatedly rerouted large parts of the Internet. This note explains how BGP works, why it is fragile, and what is being done about it.

## Parent Learning Order
IP Forwarding & the Routing Table -> Static Routing & Default Gateways -> Interior Gateway Protocols -> BGP & Internet Routing -> First-Hop Redundancy & Gateway Failover -> Routing Security & Path Validation

## Start at Zero: A Network of Networks

Interior protocols route inside one organization, where every router is trusted because one owner controls them all. The Internet has no single owner. It is a mesh of about a hundred thousand **autonomous systems (AS)** — independently operated networks, each identified by an **AS number** — that must exchange reachability information without trusting each other the way routers inside one company do.

**BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)** is the protocol they use. It is the **exterior gateway protocol** that glues the Internet together, and it works on a fundamentally different principle from interior protocols: instead of computing shortest paths over a shared map, BGP is a **path-vector** protocol in which each AS *announces* which blocks of addresses it can reach and *through which sequence of autonomous systems*. Its neighbours accept those announcements, prepend their own AS number, and pass them on.

```mermaid

    A["AS 64500 announces 203.0.113.0/24"] --> B["AS 64501 hears: reach via [64500]"]
    B --> C["AS 64502 hears: reach via [64501, 64500]"]
    C --> D["AS 64503 hears: reach via [64502, 64501, 64500]"]
    D --> P["Each AS picks a best path and re-advertises with itself prepended"]
```

The **AS-path** — the list of autonomous systems a route has traversed — serves two purposes. It lets each AS apply policy (prefer this neighbour, avoid that one), and it prevents loops: an AS that sees its own number already in a path rejects the announcement. Crucially, path selection is driven by **policy**, not by shortest distance. An AS chooses routes based on business relationships — which neighbours it pays, which pay it, which it peers with for free — so the path a packet takes across the Internet reflects commercial agreements as much as geography.

## Why BGP Is Fragile

BGP's design assumes announcements are truthful. It has, historically, **no built-in mechanism to verify that an AS is actually entitled to announce the address blocks it claims.** When an AS announces a prefix, its neighbours largely take that claim on faith.

This produces two structural failure classes.

**Prefix hijacking — claiming address space you do not own.** If an AS announces a prefix belonging to someone else, neighbours that accept the announcement will send that prefix's traffic toward the announcer. Combined with longest-prefix match, a hijacker announcing a *more specific* prefix than the legitimate owner attracts traffic globally, because more specific always wins. The traffic can be blackholed (dropped, causing an outage for the victim) or intercepted (forwarded on after inspection, an on-path position at Internet scale).

**Route leaks — propagating routes you should not.** An AS that learns routes from one neighbour and improperly re-announces them to another can pull traffic that had no business flowing through it, causing congestion, latency, or exposure. Unlike a hijack, the addresses are announced by their real owner; the fault is in who the routes are leaked *to*.

Both have caused real, large-scale incidents in which traffic for major services was rerouted through unintended networks — sometimes by accident from a configuration error, sometimes deliberately. The defining characteristic, as with all routing manipulation, is that **connectivity often still works.** Users reach the service; the traffic simply travelled somewhere it should not have, where it could be observed or delayed. This is what makes routing attacks insidious: the usual "is it up?" test passes.

## The Slow Path to Security

Because BGP's trust problem is architectural, fixing it means adding verification without breaking a system that must never stop running. The effort has proceeded in layers.

**RPKI (Resource Public Key Infrastructure)** lets an address holder cryptographically declare which AS is authorized to originate its prefixes, in a signed object called a **Route Origin Authorization (ROA)**. Networks that perform **Route Origin Validation** then check announcements against these signed records and can reject or deprioritize a route whose origin AS is not authorized. RPKI directly addresses the "wrong AS is announcing this prefix" case — the origin of a hijack.

RPKI's limitation is that it validates only the *origin*, not the whole *path*. It confirms the right AS originated the prefix but does not prove the AS-path is genuine, so a sophisticated attacker who forges a path ending in the legitimate origin can still evade origin validation. Path-validation efforts (such as BGPsec and, more pragmatically, coordinated filtering frameworks like MANRS) aim at the remaining gap, but full path security is not yet universal. The honest state of affairs is that origin validation is deploying steadily and meaningfully reduces accidental and unsophisticated hijacks, while complete path integrity remains an open, incrementally-addressed problem.

**Filtering and route registries** remain the workaday defense: networks filter which prefixes and AS-paths they accept from each neighbour, using published intent in routing registries. This is unglamorous and imperfect — it depends on every network doing its part — but it prevents a large share of leaks and hijacks in practice.

## Security Implications

**BGP is critical infrastructure with a trust model from an earlier Internet.** The protocol predates the adversarial environment it now operates in, and its security is being retrofitted while it carries essentially all inter-domain traffic. For a defender, this means BGP-level events are largely outside your control but very much within your threat model: your traffic can be rerouted by networks you have no relationship with.

**Detection is monitoring, not prevention, for most organizations.** Unless you operate your own AS, you cannot configure BGP. What you can do is monitor. Public route-monitoring services and BGP telemetry detect when your prefixes are announced by an unexpected origin or when paths to your services change suddenly. A prefix you own suddenly originated by a foreign AS is a hijack in progress, and early detection enables a response (contacting upstreams, announcing more specifics) before damage compounds.

**Encryption is the backstop, exactly as at Layer 2.** A BGP hijack can put an adversary on-path for your traffic, but a properly validated TLS session remains confidential and integrity-protected regardless of the path it takes. This is the same principle that makes end-to-end encryption non-negotiable: you cannot guarantee the path, so you must secure the payload. Certificate validation, HSTS, and increasingly encrypted transport by default are what keep a routing-level interception from becoming a data compromise.

**Availability depends on others' hygiene.** Because a route leak or hijack can blackhole your prefixes, your service availability partly depends on the filtering discipline of networks you do not control. Publishing ROAs for your own prefixes is the concrete step an address holder can take to reduce the chance that a hijack of your space is accepted globally.

No lab in this note touches the real Internet's routing. All experimentation is confined to isolated autonomous systems you own, because a BGP announcement that escapes into the global table affects networks worldwide.

## Authorized Lab: Hijack a Prefix in a Sealed Internet

Use a virtualized multi-AS lab (several BGP router instances) with **no connectivity to the real Internet**. This must be a sealed environment; a leaked announcement to the global table is a serious incident.

1. **Build three autonomous systems**, each with its own AS number, peered so routes propagate between them. Assign AS-A a prefix and have it originate that prefix.
2. **Verify legitimate routing.** From AS-C, confirm the prefix is reachable and inspect the AS-path, confirming it shows origin AS-A.
3. **Hijack it.** From AS-B, originate the *same* prefix, then originate a *more specific* prefix within it. Observe that AS-C now prefers the more specific route toward AS-B, and that traffic to the victim prefix is redirected — while still appearing reachable.
4. **Demonstrate the on-path consequence.** With AS-B forwarding the hijacked traffic onward, confirm it can observe the redirected flows, then confirm that a TLS session across the hijacked path remains encrypted end to end.
5. **Apply Route Origin Validation.** Create a signed origin authorization declaring AS-A as the only authorized origin for the prefix, enable origin validation on AS-C, and repeat the hijack. Confirm AS-C now rejects or deprioritizes AS-B's unauthorized announcement.
6. **Show the residual gap.** Have AS-B forge an AS-path that ends in AS-A while still transiting AS-B, and observe that origin validation alone does not catch this — motivating path validation.
7. **Cleanup.** Withdraw all lab announcements, remove the injected routes and validation objects if restoring a baseline, and confirm routing returns to the legitimate state.

Expected interpretation:

```text
Legitimate     -> prefix reachable via origin AS-A
More-specific hijack -> AS-C prefers AS-B; traffic redirected but still "working"
On-path        -> AS-B observes flows; TLS stays encrypted regardless of path
Origin validation -> unauthorized origin rejected; the common hijack is stopped
Forged path    -> origin validation alone misses it; path validation is the open frontier
```

## Crook → Operator → Root Checkpoint

- **Crook:** Explain why the Internet needs a different protocol than a single organization does, what an autonomous system is, and what the AS-path represents.
- **Operator:** Read a BGP route and its AS-path, explain why path selection follows policy rather than shortest distance, and describe how to monitor for a hijack of your own prefixes when you cannot configure BGP yourself.
- **Root:** Explain how more-specific announcements combined with an unauthenticated origin enable global traffic redirection; describe precisely what RPKI origin validation does and does not cover, and why end-to-end encryption is the necessary backstop for a routing layer you cannot fully trust.
