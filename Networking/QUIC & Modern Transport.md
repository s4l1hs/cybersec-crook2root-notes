# ⚡ QUIC & Modern Transport

> [!abstract] Note of [[Transport Layer & Sockets]]
> QUIC rebuilt the transport layer on top of UDP, merging reliability, multiplexing, and encryption into one protocol that middleboxes cannot inspect or ossify. This note explains the specific TCP limitations that forced the redesign, what QUIC does differently, and why a transport that hides its own control information changes what network defenders can see.

## Start at Zero: Why Replace Something That Works

TCP works. It has carried the Internet for decades. But three specific problems proved unfixable within TCP itself, and understanding them explains everything QUIC does.

**Head-of-line blocking.** TCP delivers a single ordered byte stream. If one segment is lost, everything behind it waits, even data belonging to a completely unrelated request. HTTP/2 introduced multiplexing — many logical streams over one connection — but those streams share one TCP byte stream, so a single lost packet stalls *all* of them. Multiplexing at the application layer cannot escape ordering enforced at the transport layer.

**Handshake latency.** Establishing a secure connection required a TCP handshake (one round trip) followed by a TLS handshake (one or two more). On a high-latency path, connection setup alone could cost hundreds of milliseconds before a single byte of content moved.

**Ossification.** This is the deepest problem. Because TCP headers are unencrypted, middleboxes everywhere — firewalls, load balancers, carrier equipment, inspection appliances — read and sometimes rewrite them. Many make assumptions about what TCP looks like and mishandle anything unfamiliar. The result is that new TCP options frequently fail to work in practice, not because endpoints reject them but because the network does. TCP became effectively unchangeable: any modification breaks on some fraction of paths, so nobody can deploy one. This is **protocol ossification**, and it is why fixing TCP in place was not viable.

## What QUIC Changes

**QUIC** is a transport protocol built on UDP, standardized in RFC 9000, and the transport for **HTTP/3**. Building on UDP was a deliberate choice: UDP passes through existing networks, and everything above it is defined by the endpoints, out of reach of middleboxes.

| Problem | TCP | QUIC |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Head-of-line blocking | One byte stream; loss stalls everything | Independent streams; loss stalls only its own stream |
| Handshake cost | TCP handshake + TLS handshake | Combined; often one round trip, zero for resumption |
| Encryption | Optional layer above | **Mandatory and integrated**; headers largely encrypted |
| Connection identity | The five-tuple | A **connection ID** independent of addresses |
| Evolvability | Ossified by middleboxes | Encrypted internals; middleboxes cannot ossify what they cannot read |
| Implementation | In the kernel | Usually in **user space**, so it updates with the application |

    end
```

The diagram's contrast is the core insight: in the TCP stack, multiplexing sits *above* the ordering constraint and cannot escape it. In QUIC, ordering is per-stream *inside* the transport, so independence is real.

**Connection migration** follows from the connection ID. A TCP connection is identified by its five-tuple, so changing IP address — moving from Wi-Fi to cellular — destroys it and everything must be re-established. QUIC identifies a connection by an ID carried in the packet, so the same connection survives an address change. The session continues seamlessly across networks, which is a substantial improvement for mobile clients and a substantial complication for anything that tracked flows by five-tuple.

**Zero round-trip resumption** lets a client that has connected before send application data in its very first packet, using cached parameters. The performance gain is real, and it comes with a genuine caveat: early data can be replayed by an attacker who captures it, so it must only carry idempotent requests. This is a deliberate, documented trade-off rather than a flaw.

## Observing QUIC

QUIC runs over UDP, typically port 443:

```bash
ss -uan '( sport = :443 or dport = :443 )' | head -5
```

Expected excerpt:

```text
State  Recv-Q Send-Q  Local Address:Port      Peer Address:Port
UNCONN 0      0       192.168.10.24:51284     142.250.180.4:443
```

Note `UNCONN` — the kernel sees only UDP with no connection state, because all connection state lives in user space inside the application. Everything a defender is accustomed to reading from `ss -tin` for TCP — congestion window, retransmissions, round-trip time — simply is not there. The kernel is not a participant.

Capture confirms how little is visible:

```bash
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -nn -c 4 'udp port 443'
```

Expected excerpt:

```text
IP 192.168.10.24.51284 > 142.250.180.4.443: UDP, length 1252
IP 142.250.180.4.443 > 192.168.10.24.51284: UDP, length 1252
IP 192.168.10.24.51284 > 142.250.180.4.443: UDP, length 44
```

Compare with a TCP capture, which reveals flags, sequence numbers, window sizes, and connection state transitions. Here there is a UDP header and an opaque payload. Only a small portion of the QUIC header — enough for routing and version negotiation — is unencrypted; the rest, including acknowledgments and stream framing, is protected.

### The operational surprise

A network that permits TCP/443 but blocks or rate-limits UDP/443 will find that clients "work" while performing worse than expected. Most browsers attempt QUIC and fall back to TCP when it fails, so the symptom is not an outage but silent extra latency on every first connection. Meanwhile, a firewall rule set written entirely around TCP/443 does not describe the traffic actually flowing. Verifying which transport is in use is now a necessary step:

```bash
curl -sI --http3 https://example.com | head -1
```

Expected output when QUIC succeeds:

```text
HTTP/3 200
```

## Security Implications

**Mandatory encryption is a defensive win and a visibility loss simultaneously.** Every QUIC connection is encrypted with TLS 1.3 semantics — there is no unencrypted mode — which eliminates downgrade and passive interception at the transport layer. The same property means network-based inspection that relied on reading TCP and TLS metadata sees far less. Defenders lose sequence-level visibility, connection-state telemetry, and much of the fingerprinting surface.

**The response is to move inspection to the endpoints.** Because the transport is opaque in transit and terminates in user-space application code, meaningful visibility comes from endpoint telemetry, application logs, and the server side of the connection rather than from mid-path devices. Organizations that built their detection strategy around network inspection of TCP must adapt; this is a strategic shift, not a tuning change.

**Flow tracking by five-tuple is no longer sound.** Connection migration means one logical session can span multiple five-tuples. Correlation must use the connection ID where visible, or endpoint-side session identity — otherwise a single session appears as several unrelated flows, and a session that moves networks appears to vanish and reappear.

**QUIC inherits UDP's amplification concern, and addresses it explicitly.** Because it runs over a connectionless transport, a spoofed initial packet could induce a large response. QUIC mandates **address validation**: a server may not send more than roughly three times the bytes it received from an unvalidated address, and may issue a retry token forcing the client to prove it can receive at the claimed address. This is a protocol-level fix for the structural UDP problem, and it is a useful example of a modern design confronting an old weakness head-on.

**User-space implementation changes the patch model.** TCP fixes arrive with kernel updates, centrally. QUIC implementations ship inside browsers and libraries, so a vulnerability may require updating many applications independently — faster to fix for a given vendor, harder to inventory across an estate.

All testing described here should target systems within an authorized scope; QUIC's opacity does not change scoping obligations, and probing it generates the same telemetry as any other traffic.

## Authorized Lab: Compare the Two Transports

Use a lab client and a server supporting both HTTP/2 over TCP and HTTP/3 over QUIC, with a link whose loss you can control.

1. **Baseline both transports.** Fetch the same resource over each and record the time:

```bash
curl -sw '%{http_version} %{time_total}\n' -o /dev/null --http2 https://<server>/
curl -sw '%{http_version} %{time_total}\n' -o /dev/null --http3 https://<server>/
```

2. **Compare visibility.** Capture each transfer and contrast what is readable:

```bash
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -nn -c 6 'tcp port 443'
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -nn -c 6 'udp port 443'
```

Confirm the TCP capture exposes flags, sequence numbers, and window sizes, while the QUIC capture shows opaque UDP payloads.

3. **Demonstrate head-of-line blocking.** Introduce packet loss and request several resources concurrently over each transport:

```bash
sudo tc qdisc add dev eth0 root netem loss 3%
```

Measure completion times for all concurrent requests. Over HTTP/2, expect all streams to be affected by loss on any one. Over HTTP/3, expect unaffected streams to complete normally.

4. **Demonstrate connection migration.** Start a long transfer over QUIC, then change the client's source address (switch interfaces or change the address). Confirm the QUIC transfer survives while an equivalent TCP transfer is severed and must restart.

5. **Demonstrate the fallback.** Block UDP/443 on the client and repeat the HTTP/3 request. Confirm the client silently falls back to TCP and note the added latency — the "works but slower" symptom.

6. **Cleanup.** Remove the traffic-control impairment and the UDP block, and confirm baseline timings return:

```bash
sudo tc qdisc del dev eth0 root
```

Expected interpretation:

```text
TCP capture   -> flags, sequence, window all readable by any mid-path device
QUIC capture  -> opaque payload; kernel shows UNCONN with no transport state
Loss + HTTP/2 -> one lost packet stalls every multiplexed stream
Loss + HTTP/3 -> only the affected stream stalls; others complete
Address change-> QUIC session survives via connection ID; TCP session dies
UDP blocked   -> silent fallback to TCP; not an outage, just slower
```

## Crook → Operator → Root Checkpoint

- **Crook:** Name the three TCP limitations QUIC was designed to fix, and explain in plain language what head-of-line blocking is.
- **Operator:** Identify QUIC traffic, verify which transport a client actually used, and recognize the "works but slower" signature of blocked UDP/443 with silent fallback.
- **Root:** Explain protocol ossification and why it made fixing TCP in place infeasible; describe how connection migration invalidates five-tuple flow tracking, how QUIC's address validation limits amplification inherited from UDP, and why mandatory encryption forces detection strategy from mid-path inspection toward endpoint telemetry.
